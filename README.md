# üå¥ Oil Palm Tree Detection using YOLOv5

This project implements a custom object detection model using **YOLOv5s** to identify oil palm trees from aerial or field images. The training process involves customizing the YOLOv5 architecture and utilizing a dataset from Roboflow.

## üìÅ Dataset

- **Source**: Roboflow project `pokok-kelapa-sawit`
- **Workspace**: `zarif-technologies`
- **Version**: 6
- **Format**: YOLOv5-compatible with `data.yaml`

Dataset was automatically downloaded and preprocessed using Roboflow API.
